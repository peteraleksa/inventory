# Marathon Symphony

## Git Repository
You can track my progress through writing this code in the following github repository https://github.com/peteraleksa/marathon-symphony-project

It doesn't however track the filepath change I made in the MIDI.js library to account for my file structure, so I don't know if cloning it would work to actually run the app.
  
## Prerequisites

You will need MIDI.js installed on the front end and the jsmidgen node module (npm install jsmidgen) on the back end.

## Tests

Tests are incomplete but can be run with 'grunt test'
